When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when I am in a hury. Or when I want to collaborate.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When you complete a significat change you can keep control as to when changes get committed. The changes may be small or large but significant nonetheless. Basically to retain control over your commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a copy of someone elses repository. Clone is a copy of a repository. Branches are used for a series of commits along one common theme such as an 'easy version of a video game or a different language version. I would use a fork for making changes to someone else√®s code. I would use cloning to copy one of my repositories on GitHub and I would use Branches to save new ideas or train of thoughts on an existing series of commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Don't know.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Really don't know this. Need to research this one.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Benefits of having a branch include keeping separate ideas or contributions separate.
